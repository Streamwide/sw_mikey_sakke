/**
 * Represents a single item in a cache.
 *
 * This class is very generic by design and only contains properties that can be assumed
 * to be appropriate for any kind of cachable object. When implementing a cache that
 * can contain multiple types of objects all those "cachable objects" may inherit from this
 * class in order to provide some kind of uniformity.
 *
 * A class responsible for maintaining the entire cache by periodically removing old items
 * can easily use the same code to scan all cached items as they all have the same
 * basic properies, the properties defined in by the CacheItem class.
 *
 * @todo	Add property for "associated file path", but make sure it is not a mandatory
 * 		property as cached items not necessarily have anything to do with actual files.
