 *
 * Threads created using the Thread class in libmutil
 * will catch all Exceptions and output the stack trace.
 * This is useful when debugging.
 *
 * The stack trace output contains the "mangled" name.
 * You can "un-mangle" it by using the "c++filt" command
 * in linux.

 * Note: Stack trace is not supported on W32 and WinCE.
